<p>&ldquo;<i>The</i> little bronze flint <i>and</i> tinder box illustrated,
was found in 1888 by <i>the</i> present Museum Director,
then <i>a</i> small boy. His brother dislodged <i>a</i> stone while
they were climbing around <i>the</i> fort. Under <i>the</i> stone
was this box with flint <i>and</i> tinder in it. Bronze <i>and of</i>
French design, it must have belonged to some important
officer, probably Montcalm de Levis, Bougainville
<i>or</i> Bourlamacque. <i>The</i> busts represent Cupid <i>and</i>
Psyche; <i>the</i> faces are extraordinarily beautiful <i>and</i>
expressive. <i>The</i> box measures 2&frac14; <i>by</i> 1&frac14; inches.</p>
<p>I consider this box <i>and the</i> back plate <i>for the</i>
suit <i>of</i> half-armor (<i>found a few years ago</i>) <i>the</i> most
interesting <i>of the</i> thousands <i>of</i> articles found <i>at the</i>
Fort.</p>
<p><i>This</i> little box stimulated <i>the</i> Director&rsquo;s interest.
Even as a small boy he hoped some day to preserve
<i>and</i> perhaps restore Fort Ticonderoga. Many <i>a</i> year
was to pass before <i>this</i> dream could become <i>a</i> reality.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When Columbus was landing in the West Indies, and
discovering America, the Champlain Valley was thickly
populated. There are signs of Indian village sites all along
the shores and the thousands of stone implements, arrow and
spear points, scrapers, hatchets, pestles and mortars that are
turned up each year indicate an occupation of hundreds,
probably thousands, of years. But when the first white man
arrived all was silence and desolation. The fierce Iroquois
from the south had not long before slaughtered the peaceful
Algonquin Indians and driven the survivors back into the
mountains, where they were living a hand to mouth existence.
In fact so degenerate had they become that the
Iroquois referred to them as &ldquo;Adirondacks&rdquo; or &ldquo;Bark-eaters,&rdquo;
because of their necessity of depending on the bark
of trees during the winter when game was scarce. Remains
of these people are so many that for a hundred years arrow
heads and other stone implements have been found on the
shore of the lake under the walls of the Fort and yet each
rain and wind storm discloses new ones. These Indians
were a partly agricultural people as shown by the many
bits of pottery and hoes that are found, but little is definitely
known of them or their habits.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_11">11</div>
<h2 id="c2"><span class="small">CHAPTER TWO</span>
<br /><span class="sc">Champlain</span></h2>
<p>In May, 1609, the same year that Hendrick Hudson discovered
and named Hudson&rsquo;s River, Samuel de Champlain
with a contingent of eleven Frenchmen, a small body of
Montagnais Indians and between two and three hundred
Hurons left Quebec on an exploring expedition to the south.</p>
<p>At the rapids of the Richelieu, Champlain quarreled
with his Indians, who had assured him that there was smooth
water from the St. Lawrence to the great lake to the south.
Three-quarters of them went home and with them he sent
all but two of his white companions. His force now consisted
of three Frenchmen and sixty Montagnais and Hurons.</p>
<p>They traveled in twenty-four canoes and soon entered
Lake Champlain, and, as they now were approaching the
Iroquois country, they traveled by night and hid in the
woods by day.</p>
<p>Champlain&rsquo;s own description of his discovery and the
battle at Ticonderoga from his &ldquo;Voyages and Discoveries&rdquo;
published in Paris, 1613 ... reads as follows:</p>
<p>&ldquo;We left next day, continuing our route along the river
as far as the mouth of the Lake. Here are a number of
beautiful, but low islands filled with very fine woods and
prairies, a quantity of game and wild animals, such as stags,
deer, fawns, roe-bucks, bears and other sorts of animals that
come from the main land to the said islands. We caught a
quantity of them. There is also quite a number of beavers,
as well in the river as in several other streams which fall
into it. These parts, though agreeable, are not inhabited by
any Indians, in consequence of their wars. They retire from
the rivers as far as possible, deep into the country, in order
not to be so soon discovered.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">12</div>
<p>&ldquo;Next day we entered the lake, which is of considerable
extent; some 50 or 60 leagues in length, where I saw 4 beautiful
islands, 10, 12 and 15 leagues in length formerly inhabited,
as well as the Iroquois river, by Indians, but abandoned
since they have been at war the one with the other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Several rivers, also, discharge into the lake, surrounded
by a number of fine trees similar to those we have in France,
with a quantity of vines handsomer than any I ever saw; a
great many chestnuts, and I have not yet seen except the
margin of the lake, where there is a large abundance of
fish of divers species. Among the rest there is one called by
the Indians of the country Chaousarou, the divers lengths.
The largest I was informed by the people, are of eight to ten
feet. I saw one of 5, as thick as a thigh, with a head as big
as two fists, with jaws two feet and a half long, and a
double set of very sharp and dangerous teeth. The form of
the body resembles that of the pike, and it is armed with
scales that a thrust of a poniard cannot pierce; and is of a
silver grey colour. The point of the snout is like that of a
hog. This fish makes war on all others in the lakes and
rivers and possesses, as those people assure me, a wonderful
instinct; which is, that when it wants to catch any birds, it
goes among the rushes or reeds, bordering the lake in many
places, keeping the beak out of the water without budging,
so that when the birds perch on his beak, imagining it a
limb of a tree, it is so subtle that closing the jaws which it
keeps half open, it draws the birds under water by the feet.
The Indians gave me a head of it, which they prize highly,
saying, when they have a headache they let blood with the
teeth of this fish at the seat of the pain which immediately
goes away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Continuing our route along the west side of the lake,
contemplating the country, I saw on the east side very high
mountains capped with snow. I asked the Indians if those
parts were inhabited? They answered me, Yes, and that they
were Iroquois, and that there were in those parts beautiful
valleys, and fields fertile in corn as good as I had ever eaten
<span class="pb" id="Page_13">13</span>
in the country, with an infinitude of other fruits, and that
the lake extended close to the mountains, which were,
according to my judgment, 15 leagues from us. I saw others,
to the South, not less high than the former; only, that they
were without snow. The Indians told me it was there we
were to go to meet their enemies, and that they were thickly
inhabited, and that we must pass by a waterfall which I
afterwards saw, and thence enter another lake three or four
leagues, long, and having arrived at its head, there were 4
leagues overland to be traveled to pass to a river which flows
toward the coast of the Almouchiquois, tending towards that
of the Almouchiquois, and that they were only two days
going there in their canoes, as I understood since from some
prisoners we took, who, by means of some Algonquin interpreters,
who were acquainted with the Iroquois language,
conversed freely with me about all they had noticed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, on coming within about two or three days
journey of the enemy&rsquo;s quarters, we traveled only by night
and rested by day. Nevertheless, they never omitted their
usual superstitions to ascertain whether their enterprise
would be successful, and often asked me whether I had
dreamed and seen their enemies. I answered no; and
encouraged them and gave them good hopes. Night fell,
and we continued our journey until morning when we
withdrew into the picket fort to pass the remainder of the
day there. About ten or eleven o&rsquo;clock I lay down after
having walked some time around our quarters, and falling
asleep, I thought I beheld our enemies, the Iroquois, drowning
within sight of us in the Lake near a mountain; and
being desirous to save them, that our savage allies told me
that I must let them all perish as they were good for
nothing. On awakening, they did not omit, as usual to ask
me, if I had any dream, I did tell them, in fact, what I had
dreamed. It gained such credit among them that they no
longer doubted but they should meet with success.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">15</div>
<p>&ldquo;At nightfall we embarked in our canoes to continue
our journey, and as we advanced very softly and noiselessly,
we encountered a war party of Iroquois, on the twenty-ninth
of the month, about ten o&rsquo;clock, at night, at the point of a
cape which juts into the lake on the west side. They and
we began to shout, each seizing his arms. We withdrew
towards the water and the Iroquois repaired on shore, and
arranged all their canoes, the one beside the other, and
began to hew down trees with villainous axes, which they
sometimes got in war, and others of stone, and fortified
themselves very securely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our party, likewise, kept their canoes arranged the
one alongside the other, tied to poles so as not to run adrift,
in order to fight all together should need be. We were on
the water about an arrow-shot from their barricades.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When they were armed and in order, they sent two
canoes from the fleet to know if their enemies wished to
fight, who answered they desired nothing else; but that just
then, there was not much light, and that we must wait for
day to distinguish each other, and that they would give us
battle at sun rise. This was agreed to by our party. Meanwhile
the whole night was spent in dancing and singing, as
well on one side as on the other, mingled with an infinitude
of insults and other taunts, such as the little courage we had;
how powerless our resistance against their arms, and that
when day would break we should experience this to our ruin.
Ours, likewise, did not fail in repartee; telling them they
should witness the effects of arms they had never seen before;
and a multitude of other speeches, as is usual at a
siege of a town. After the one and the other had sung,
danced and parliamented enough, day broke. My companions
and I were always concealed, for fear the enemy
should see us preparing our arms the best we could, being
however separated, each in one of the canoes belonging to
the savage Montagnais. After being equipped with light
armour we took each an arquebus and went ashore. I saw
<span class="pb" id="Page_16">16</span>
the enemy leave their barricade; they were about 200 men,
of strong and robust appearance, who were coming slowly
towards us, with a gravity and assurance which greatly
pleased me, led on by three Chiefs. Our&rsquo;s were marching
in similar order, and told me that those who bore three
lofty plumes were the Chiefs, and that there were but these
three and they were to be recognized by those plumes, and
that I must do all I could to kill them. I promised to do
what I could, and that I was very sorry they could not
clearly understand me, so as to give them the order and
plan of attacking their enemies, as we should indubitably
defeat them all; but there was no help for that; that I was
very glad to encourage them and to manifest to them my
good will when we should be engaged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The moment we landed they began to run about two
hundred paces toward their enemies who stood firm, and
had not yet perceived my companions, who went into the
bush with some savages. Our&rsquo;s commenced calling me in a
loud voice, and making way for me, opened in two parts,
and placed me at their head, marching about 20 paces in
advance, until I was within 30 paces of the enemy. The
moment they saw me, they halted, gazing at me and I at
them. When I saw them preparing to shoot at us, I raised
my arquebus, and aiming directly at one of the three Chiefs,
two of them fell to the ground by this shot and one of their
companions received a wound of which he died afterwards.
I had put 4 balls in my arquebus. Our&rsquo;s on witnessing a
shot so favorable for them, set up such tremendous shouts
that thunder could not have been heard; and yet, there
was no lack of arrows on one side and the other. The
Iroquois were greatly astonished seeing two men killed so
instantaneously, notwithstanding they were provided with
arrow-proof armour woven of cotton-thread and wood; this
frightened them very much. Whilst I was reloading, one of
my companions in the bush fired a shot, which so astonished
them anew, seeing their Chiefs slain, that they lost courage,
took flight and abandoned the field and their fort, hiding
<span class="pb" id="Page_17">17</span>
themselves in the depths of the forest, whither pursuing
them, I killed some others. Our savages also killed several
of them and took ten or twelve prisoners. The rest carried
off the wounded. Fifteen or sixteen of ours were wounded
by arrows; they were promptly cured.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After having gained the victory, they amused themselves
plundering Indian corn and meal from the enemy;
also their arms which they had thrown away in order to
run the better. And having feasted, danced and sung, we
returned three hours afterwards with the prisoners.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The place where this battle was fought is in 43 degrees
some minutes latitude, and I named it Lake Champlain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Historians agree that this fight took place on the low
ground, northeast of the Fort at Ticonderoga. It was the
Iroquois&rsquo; first introduction to firearms and forever alienated
that great fighting confederation from the French.</p>

<h2 id="c3"><span class="small">CHAPTER THREE</span>
<br /><span class="sc">The Building of the Fort</span></h2>
<p>From 1609 to 1755 nothing of great interest happened
at Ticonderoga. War parties, explorers and traders passed
up and down the lake in a steady stream, but few left
records. The English pushed north as far as the south
end of Lake George and built Fort William Henry; the
French, as far south as Crown Point and built Fort St.
Frederic. All between was a wild country, claimed by both
France and Great Britain.</p>
<p>In 1755 Michel Chartier, afterwards Marquis de Lotbiniere,
under instruction from the Marquis de Vaudreuil,
Governor-General of New France, came down from Crown
Point to select a site for a new fort. His aide-memoire
from de Vaudreuil is in the Fort Library. In October he
started cutting the great trees and leveling the ground to
build the stone fortress which he first called Fort Vaudreuil,
but which was afterwards given the name of Carillon, &ldquo;A
Chime of Bells,&rdquo; named from the sound of the falls where
the water from Lake George runs into Lake Champlain. He
employed the garrison from Crown Point and at one time
as many as 2,000 men were at work and made extraordinary
progress, considering that he was erecting a fort in the
wilderness.</p>
<p>Robert Rogers, the famous ranger, several times during
the building of the Fort reconnoitered and reported on the
progress of the work. September 9, 1756, he says:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was within a mile of Ticonderoga fort where I
endeavored to reconnoitre the enemy&rsquo;s works and strength.
They were engaged in raising the walls of the fort and
erecting a large blockhouse near the southeast corner of the
fort with ports in it for cannon. East from the blockhouse
was a battery which I imagined commanded the lake.&rdquo;</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">21</div>
<p>He also reports the French to be building a sawmill at
the lower end of the falls. On Christmas Eve, 1757, Rogers
got close enough to kill about seventeen head of cattle and
set fire to the wood piles of the garrison. To the horns of
one of the cattle, he attached a note to the commander of
the fort:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am obliged to you, sir, for the repose you have
allowed me to take. I thank you for the fresh meat you have
sent me. I will take care of my prisoners. I request you to
present my compliments to the Marquis de Montcalm.</p>
<p><span class="lr">(Signed) &ldquo;Rogers, Commander of the Independent Companies.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>In 1755, Baron de Dieskau had gone from Crown Point
to attack Sir William Johnson at Lake George. Dieskau was
wounded, and his defeated army fought their way back to
Ticonderoga.</p>
<p>In March, 1758, Rogers&rsquo; famous battle on snowshoes
was fought a few miles from Ticonderoga when the French
under Captain Durentaye, commanding a party of Indians
and Canadians, captured and destroyed most of his force.</p>
<p>The guns which De Lotbiniere mounted on the Fort
were mostly from Crown Point and Montreal but some were
brought from Fort William Henry in 1757 when Montcalm
captured that fort from Lieut. Col. Munro. It was after
Munro&rsquo;s surrender that the famous massacre of Fort William
Henry occurred. The British garrison was marching unarmed
to Fort Edward when it was attacked by Montcalm&rsquo;s
Indians. The French officers did their best to protect the
garrison but many were slain.</p>
<p>De Lotbiniere wrote to the Minister from Carillon on
the 31st October, 1756:</p>

<p class="pcap"><span class="sc">Major Robert Rogers</span></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">23</div>
<p>&ldquo;My Lord:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was so much occupied last year at the departure of
the last ships that it was not possible for me to render you an
account of the St. Frederic campaign, which M. de Vaudreuil
ordered me to begin immediately after M. de Dieskau&rsquo;s
affair. I left with orders to examine the Carillon Point ...
where the waters of the Grande Baye and of Lake St.
Sacrement meet. At this point is the head of the navigation
of Lake Champlain. M. de Vaudreuil feared with reason
that, the enemy gaining possession of it, it would be very
difficult for us to dislodge him, and that being solidly
established there, [and we] would be exposed to see him
appear in the midst of our settlements at the moment we
least expected, it being possible for him to make during winter
all necessary preparations to operate in the spring.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I found on my arrival at St. Frederic an intrenchment
begun on wrong principles which I felt obliged to continue
to be agreeable to the Commandant of the Army who feared
the enemy might at any moment attack the Fort. At last,
on the 12th October, on the order of M. le Marquis de
Vaudreuil, these works ceased and we moved the camp
from St. Frederic to Carillon to begin a Fort at the location
which I should find to be most suitable for such purpose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I decided to establish it on the ridge of rock which
runs from the point to the falls of Lake St. Sacrement. As
the season did not permit of our hoping to accomplish much
work before winter I was obliged to restrict my efforts more
than I would have liked so as to at least place the garrison
under cover until the spring.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I contented myself with reserving sufficient ground in
the front for a camp of 2,000 to 3,000 men, if need be,
covered by the Fort, and although I was obliged to operate
in the midst of a wood without being able to see while
surveying more than thirty yards ahead of me, I think I
was fortunate enough to have made the best use of the
ground I was ordered to fortify. We were not prepared to
build in stone, having neither the material assembled nor the
workmen. We were therefore obliged to line the works in
oak which fortunately was plentiful on the spot. I began
the parapet of the whole work which I formed in a double
row of timbers distant ten feet from one another and bound
together by two cross-pieces dovetailed at their extremities,
to retain the timbers. This had reached the height of seven
feet by the 28th November, date of the departure of the
army, which could not remain longer owing to the ice
beginning to form.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">25</div>
<p>&ldquo;I remained until February hoping to be able to use the
garrison to advance the works; but finding that it was not
possible to make the garrison work, I decided to return to
Montreal after the barracks had been finished, to recuperate
from the fatigues of the campaign and the unwholesome
food I had taken.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I left [Montreal] this year [1756] at the end of April
and arrived at the Fort the first days of May, when I
resumed work which dragged on for nearly a month not
having the required workmen. During this campaign we
raised all the Fort to the height of the cordon. The earth
ramparts were made,&mdash;the platforms of the bastions completed,
a cover built for each bastion bomb-proof, two stone
barracks built, the ditches of the place dug to the rock
everywhere, part of the rock even removed on two fronts,
the ditches of the two demi-lunes also excavated to the
rock, a store-house established outside the Fort as well as
a hospital. The parapet was raised on the two fronts
exposed to the enemy&rsquo;s batteries if he undertook to besiege
this place, the exterior part of the Fort supported by masonry
resting on the solid rock. The next campaign will be
devoted to overhauling the main body of the place and
building the two demi-lunes proposed, as well as the redoubt
at the extreme of the Carillon Point. We will also work
at the covered way and the glacis. There will be two
barracks to build in stone in the interior of the Fort. As
there is but one bastion exposed to attack I think it would
be well to protect it by a counter guard. This would constitute
an additional obstruction which might discourage the
enemy from any attack on that side and, should he do so,
I would hope that the place, once completed, he would not
succeed. I would be flattered, My Lord, if you gave me
<span class="pb" id="Page_26">26</span>
your orders to work with more latitude and, if you approve
the counter guard which would not be very expensive, I
would beg of you to order it by the first ships coming from
France in order to embrace at the same time the whole
works. M. le Comte de la Galissoniere to whom I communicated
the information which I have acquired on this
district will not let you ignore how advantageous it is and
of what consequence it is to France. I presume to flatter
myself, My Lord, that you will consider me for the position
occupied heretofore by M. de Lery. I think I have worked
in a manner to deserve it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was during the summer of 1757 that De Lotbiniere
started to substitute stone for most of the timbers he had
used on the outer walls of the Fort.</p>

<br /><span class="sc">Abercromby&rsquo;s Defeat</span></h2>
<p>In 1758 the Fort was almost completed. General James
Abercromby had gathered at the head of Lake George the
greatest army ever seen on the American continent, almost
15,000 men, of which 6,000 were British regulars and the rest
provincials from New England, New York and New Jersey.</p>
<p>In July, 1758, this great army, great for its day and
place, left Fort William Henry in hundreds of batteaux and
whale boats to attack Fort Carillon. It must have been an
extraordinarily beautiful sight, that vast fleet of little boats
filled with the Red Coats and the plaids of Highlanders. Early
in the morning of July 6th the army landed on what is
now known as Howe&rsquo;s Cove at the northern end of Lake
George. The army immediately advanced in three columns
but was soon lost in the dense forest which then covered the
whole country. An advance party of French under the Sieur
de Trepezec had been watching the landing from what the
French called Mount Pelee, but which is now called Roger&rsquo;s
Rock. In trying to return to the Fort they had also lost their
way and met one of the advancing columns, commanded by
George Augustus, Viscount Howe, a grandson of George the
First of England. At the first fire Lord Howe was killed and
with his death the heart went out of the army. He was the
real leader of the expedition. Captain Monypenny, his aide,
reported his death in the following letter:</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_29">29</div>
<p>To Mr. Calcraft, dated Camp at Lake George, 11th
July, 1758:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is with the utmost concern, I write you of the
death of Lord Howe. On the 6th the whole army landed
without opposition, at the carrying place, about seven miles
from Ticonderoga. About two o&rsquo;clock, they march&rsquo;d in four
columns, to invest the breast work, where the enemy was
encamp&rsquo;d, near the Fort. The Rangers were before the army
and the light infantry and marksmen at the heads of the
columns. We expected, and met with some opposition near
a small river, which we had to cross. When the firing began
on the part of the left column, Lord Howe thinking it
would be of the greatest consequence, to beat the enemy
with the light troops, so as not to stop the march of the
main body, went up with them, and had just gained the
top of the hill, where the firing was, when he was killed.
Never ball had a more deadly direction. It entered his
breast on the left side, and (as the surgeans say) pierced his
lungs, and heart, and shattered his back bone. I was about
six yards from him, he fell on his back and never moved,
only his hands quivered an instant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The French party was about 400 men, &rsquo;tis computed
200 of them were killed, 160, whereof five are officers, are
prisoners; their commanding officer, and the partizan who
conducted them were killed, by the prisoner&rsquo;s account, in
short, very few, if any, got back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The loss our country has sustained in His Lordship
is inexpressible, and I&rsquo;m afraid irreparable. The spirit he
inspired in the troops, indefatigable pains he took in forwarding
the publick service, the pattern he show&rsquo;d of every
military virtue, can only be believed by those, who were
eye witnesses of it. The confidence the army, both regular
and provincial, had in his abilities as a general officer, the
readiness with which every order of his, or ev&rsquo;n intimation
of what would be agreeable to him, was comply&rsquo;d with, is
almost incredible. When his body was brought into camp
scarce an eye was free from tears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As his Lordship had chose me to act as an aide de
camp to him, when he was to have commanded on the
winter expedition, which did not take place, and afterwards
on his being made a brigadier general, had got me appointed
Brigade Major, and I had constantly lived with him since
that time....&rdquo;</p>

</div>
<p>The three columns returned to the landing place on the
6th, and on the 7th the army again advanced, this time by
way of the bridge over the small stream connecting Lake
George with Lake Champlain. The French had destroyed
the bridge in retreating but it was soon repaired. On the
night of the 7th the whole army lay on their arms, in what
is now the Village of Ticonderoga, and on the morning of the
8th advanced again in three columns to attack the Fort. In
the meantime Montcalm had elected not to wait until the
Fort was invested but to fight in the woods. With almost
superhuman energy he threw an earthwork across the whole
peninsula of Ticonderoga, about three-quarters of a mile
from the Fort. It consisted of a great wall of logs, and an
abatis of trees with their branches sharpened, a hundred
feet or so from the trenches. He, himself, commanded the
<span class="pb" id="Page_31">31</span>
center, the Chevalier de L&eacute;vis the right, and the Colonel
de Bourlamaque the left. Early in the morning the British
columns attacked. All through that hot, sultry July day the
fight went on. Abercromby had established his headquarters
at the French sawmill but had been deceived as to the
strength of Montcalm&rsquo;s defenses. In this fight the 42nd
Highlanders, the famous Black Watch, suffered enormously.
Many of the Highlanders fought their way through the
abatis and some even reached the great log wall, only to
be killed by bayonet or bullet. The Royal American, a regiment
still in the British army as the King&rsquo;s Royal Rifle
Corps, had losses second only to the Black Watch. And at
the end of the day Abercromby&rsquo;s army was forced to retreat,
leaving the French in command of the field. The British
and Colonial losses in this fight were almost as great as the
whole French defending force.</p>
<h3>Account of the Victory Won By the Royal Troops at Carillon on the 8th Day of July, 1758</h3>
<p class="center">(Translated from a contemporary French manuscript report in the Museum Library)</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Marquis de Vaudreuil, uncertain of the movements
of the enemy, thought necessary at the beginning of
this campaign to distribute his forces. He appointed the
Chevalier de L&eacute;vis to execute a secret expedition with a
picked detachment, of which 400 men were chosen from the
land troops. The rest of these troops were sent by order
of the Marquis de Montcalm to defend the border of Lake
Saint Sacrement [Lake George]. The Marquis de Montcalm
arrived at Carillon the 30th of June. The report of
prisoners made a few days before left him no doubt that
the enemy had gathered, near the ruins of Fort William
Henry, an army of 20,000 to 25,000 men and that their
intention was to advance immediately upon him.</p>

</div>
<p>&ldquo;He imparted at once this news to the Marquis de Vaudreuil
and did not hesitate to take an advanced position
which would deceive the enemy, retard his movement and
give time for the colonial help to arrive. In consequence,
le Sieur de Bourlamaque was ordered to take possession of
the portage at the head of Lake Saint Sacrement, with the
battalions of La Reine, of Guyenne and of Bearn. The
Marquis de Montcalm, with those of La Sarre, of the
Royal Roussillon, of the Languedoc Regiment and the 1st
battalion of Berry, occupied personally the two banks of
the Chute River, thus named because in that spot the
Lake St. Sacrement, narrowed by the mountains, pours its
bubbling waters into the St. Frederic River and Lake
Champlain. The 2nd Berry battalion took charge of the
defense and service at the Fort of Carillon.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_33">33</div>
<p>&ldquo;The Marquis de Montcalm made the Sieurs de
Pontleroy and D&eacute;sandrouins, Engineers, reconnoitre and
determine a site for a fortified position which could cover
this fort; and as we had only a few Canadians and only 15
savages, he took from the French battalions two troops of
volunteers, the command of which was given to the Sieur
Bernard, captain in the Bearn Regiment, and Duprat, captain
in La Sarre Regiment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the evening of the 5th scouts which we had on
Lake Saint Sacrement informed us that they had seen large
numbers of barges which might be and were, in fact, the
vanguard of the enemy&rsquo;s army. At once the order was
given to the troops of the Portage and the Chute camps to
take their armaments, to spend the night at the bivouac,
and to clear the equipages. The volunteers of Duprat were
sent to take position on a creek called the Bernetz which,
flowing between the mountains that cover this part of the
country, runs into the Chute River. The enemy could pass
around us by the back of these mountains. It was essential
to be aware of such a movement. 350 men under the command
of the Sieur de Trepezec, captain in the Bearn Regiment,
were detached to take a position between the Pelee
Mountain and the left bank of Lake Saint Sacrement and
the volunteers of Bernard occupied another post intermediary
between the Pelee Mountain and the Portage camps.
Measures were taken also to throw light on a possible disembarkment
which the enemy might make on the right bank
of the lake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The 6th. At four o&rsquo;clock in the morning, the vanguard
of the opponent&rsquo;s army was located in sight of the
portage. At once the Marquis de Montcalm sent orders to
<span class="pb" id="Page_34">34</span>
the Sieurs de Pontleroy and D&eacute;sandrouins to lay out, in front
of Carillon on the ground already marked, trenches and
abatis and to the 2nd Battalion of Berry to work at them
with its ensigns.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig17">
<img src="images/p18.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="737" />
<p class="pcap"><span class="sc">Major General Israel Putnam</span></p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;The enemy began to disembark at nine o&rsquo;clock; the
Sieur de Bourlamaque retreated then in their presence with
the 3rd battalion from the portage and in the best of order.
He joined the Marquis de Montcalm who was waiting for
<span class="pb" id="Page_35">35</span>
him, formed for battle, on the heights at the right bank
of the Chute, with Roussillon Regiment and the first Berry
Battalion; these five battalions passed the river, destroyed
the bridge and combined with La Sarre and Languedoc
Regiments occupied the heights which edge the left bank.
This retreat would have been carried out without the loss
of a single man, if the detachment of the Sieur de Trepezec
had not lost its way. Abandoned by the few savages that
acted as guides, it strayed in those wood-covered mountains
and came, after walking 12 hours, upon an English column
bound for the Chute River. Of this detachment 6 officers
and about 150 soldiers were killed or made prisoners. They
defended themselves a long time, but they had to retreat
before a superior force. The English made an important
loss in the person of Lord Howe, quartermaster general of
their army and Colonel of one of the Regiments of old
England.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At six o&rsquo;clock in the evening, the Sieur Duprat, having
announced that the enemy was heading towards the Bernetz
Creek with pioneers and that their plan was evidently to
throw a bridge over it, the Marquis de Montcalm sent the
order to retreat and started his own retreat towards the
heights of Carillon, where he arrived at sunset. That same
evening a portion of the opponents&rsquo; regular troops and
Rangers occupied the two banks of the Chute River, going
towards the Bernetz Creek and entrenching there. The rest
of their army occupied the place of disembarkment and the
portage, and entrenched there also.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The 7th. The French army was all employed working
at the abatis which had been started the day before by the
2nd Berry Battalion. The officers were setting the example
and the flags were hoisted&mdash;the plan of the defences had
been laid out on the heights, 650 fathoms from Carillon fort.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the left side it was backed up by an embankment
80 fathoms away from the Chute River, the top of which
was capped by a wall. This wall was flanked by a gap
<span class="pb" id="Page_36">36</span>
back of which 6 cannon were to be placed to fire at it as
well as to the river. On the right it was also backed by
an embankment the slope of which was not as steep as the
one on the left; the plain between this hill and Lake Saint
Sacrement River was bordered by a branch of the trenches
and also by a battery of 4 cannon which were only placed
there the day after the battle. Also the guns of the Fort
were pointed toward this plain as well as at any other disembarkment
which might be effected on the left.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The center followed the sinuosities of the ground,
keeping the top of the height, and all the parts flanked one
another reciprocally. Several, to tell the truth, were hit
there, as well as on the right and on the left by a cross fire
of the enemy, but it was because we didn&rsquo;t have time to put
up traverses. That kind of defence was made by tree trunks
put one on top of the other, and had in front of it fallen
trees the branches of which, cut and sharpened, gave the
effect of a chevaux de frise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Between 6 and 8 o&rsquo;clock in the evening the piquets of
our troops, detached by order of the Chevalier de L&eacute;vis,
arrived at the camp and the Chevalier de L&eacute;vis himself
went there at night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All day our volunteers fired against the Rangers of
the enemy. General Abercromby with the main part of the
militia and the balance made up of regular troops advanced
up to the falls. He had sent there several barges and pontoons
mounted with two guns each. These troops built also
on the same day several trenches, one in front of the other,
of which the nearest one to our abatis was hardly a cannon
range away. We spent the night in bivouac along side the
trenches.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The 8th. At dawn we beat the drums so as to let all
the troops know their posts for the defense of the entrenchment,
following the above arrangement, which was about
that in which they worked. The army was composed at the
right of battalions of La Reine, La Sarre, Royal Roussillon,
<span class="pb" id="Page_37">37</span>
Languedoc and Guyenne Regiments and two Berry and the
one battalion of the Bearn Regiment and also of 450
Canadians or Marines which brought the total to 3,000
fighting men.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At the left of the line they posted the Sarre and the
Languedoc battalions and the two piquets that had arrived
the day before. The volunteers of Bernard and Duprat
were guarding the gap on the Chute River.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The center was occupied by the first Berry Battalion,
by one Royal Roussillon and by the rest of the piquets of
the Chevalier de L&eacute;vis.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Battalions of La Reine, the Bearn and the Guyenne
defended the right and in the plain between the embankment
of this right [flank] and the Saint Frederic River they
had posted the colonial troops and the Canadians, defended
also by abatis. On the whole front of the line each battalion
had back of itself a company of grenadiers and a piquet in
reserve to support their battalion and also to be able to
move where they might be needed. The Chevalier de L&eacute;vis
took charge of the right, the Sieur de Bourlamaque of the
left, the Marquis de Montcalm kept the center for himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This arrangement, fixed and known, the troops at
once fell back to work, some of them busy improving the
abatis, the rest erecting the two batteries mentioned above
and a redoubt to protect the right.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That day in the morning, Colonel [Sir William] Johnson
joined the English army with 300 savages of the Five
Nations with &lsquo;Tchactas,&rsquo; the Wolf, and Captain Jacob with
140 more. Soon after we saw them, as well as some Rangers,
standing on a mountain opposite Carillon on the other side
of the Chute River. They even discharged much musketry
which interrupted the work. We did not bother answering
them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At half past twelve, the English army debouched upon
us. The company of grenadiers, the volunteers and the
<span class="pb" id="Page_38">38</span>
advanced guards retreated in good order and joined the
line again. At the same movement and at a given signal
all the troops took their posts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The left was attacked first by two columns, one of
which was trying to turn the trenches and found itself under
the fire of La Sarre Regiment, the other directed its efforts
on a salient between the Languedoc and the Berry battalions.
The center, where the Royal Roussillon was, was attacked
almost at the same time by a third column; a fourth attacked
the right between the Bearn and La Reine battalions.
All these columns were intermingled with their Rangers and
their best riflemen, covered by the trees, kept up a murderous
fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At the beginning of the fight several barges and pontoons
coming from the Chute advanced in sight of Carillon.
The steadiness of the volunteers of Bernard and Duprat,
supported by Sieur de Poulharies at the head of a company
of grenadiers and of a piquet of the Royal Roussillon, with
a few cannon shots fired from the fort, made them retreat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These different attacks were almost all in the afternoon
and almost everywhere of the greatest intensity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As the Canadians and the colonial troops had not
been attacked they directed their fire upon the column
which was attacking our right and which from time to time
was within their range. This column, made up of English
grenadiers and of Scotch Highlanders, charged repeatedly
for three hours without either being rebuked or broken
up, and several were killed at only fifteen feet from our lines.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At about five o&rsquo;clock the column which had attacked
vigorously the Royal Roussillon threw itself back on the
salient defended by the Regiment of Guyenne and by the
left wing of the Bearn, the column which had attacked the
right wing drew back also, so that the danger became urgent
in those parts. The Chevalier de L&eacute;vis moved there with a
few troops of the right [wing] at which the enemy was
shooting. The Marquis de Montcalm hastened there also
<span class="pb" id="Page_39">39</span>
with some of the reserves and the enemy met a resistance
which slowed up, at last, their ardor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The left was still standing up against the firing of two
columns which were endeavoring to break through that part.
The Sieur de Bourlamaque had been dangerously wounded
there at about 4 o&rsquo;clock and Sieur de Senezeraque and de
Privast, Lieutenant Colonels of La Sarre and the Languedoc
Regiments were taking his place and giving the best of
orders. The Marquis de Montcalm rushed there several
times and took pains to have help sent there in all critical
moments.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At 6 o&rsquo;clock the two columns on the right gave up
attacking the Guyenne battalions and made one more attempt
against the Royal Roussillon and Berry. At last, after
a last effort to the left, at 7 o&rsquo;clock, the enemy retreated,
protected by the shooting of the Rangers, which kept on
until night. They abandoned on the battlefield their dead
and some of their wounded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The darkness of the night, the exhaustion and small
number of our troops, the strength of the enemy which, in
spite of its defeat, was still in numbers superior to us, the
nature of these woods in which one could not, without assistance
of the savages, start out against an army which must
have had from 400 to 500 of them, several trenches built in
echelon from the battlefield up to their camp, those are the
obstacles that prevented us following the enemy in its retreat.
We even thought that they would attempt to take their
revenge and we worked all night to escape attack from the
neighboring heights by traverses, to improve the Canadian
abatis, and to finish the batteries of the left and of the right
[flanks] which had been begun in the morning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The 9th. Our volunteers having informed the Marquis
de Montcalm that the post of the Chute and of the portage
seemed abandoned, he gave orders to the Chevalier de L&eacute;vis
to go the next day at day break with the grenadiers, the
volunteers and the Canadians to reconnoitre what had become
of the enemy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">40</div>
<p>&ldquo;The Chevalier de L&eacute;vis advanced beyond the portage.
He found everywhere the vestige of a hurried flight wounded,
supplies, abandoned equipage, debris of barges and
charred pontoons, unquestionable proofs of the great
loss which the enemy had made. We estimate it at about
4,000 men killed or wounded. Were we to believe some of
them, and judge by the promptitude of their retreat, it
would be still more considerable. They have lost several
officers and generals, Lord Howe, Sir Spitall, Major General
Commander in Chief of the forces of New York, and several
others.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The savages of the Five Nations remained as spectators
at the tail of the column; they were waiting probably to
declare themselves after the result of a fight which, to the
English, did not seem doubtful.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The orders which were published in their colonies for
the levying and upkeep of this army, announces the <b>general
invasion of Canada</b> and the same statements are made in all
the commissions of their officers and militia. We must do
them justice in saying that they attacked us with the most
ardent tenacity. It is not ordinary that trenches have stood
seven hours&rsquo; attack at a stretch and almost without respite.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We owe this victory to good man&oelig;uvres of our generals
before and during the action and to the extraordinary,
unbelievable gallantry of our troops. All the officers of the
army behaved in a way that each one of them deserves
special praise. We have had about 350 men killed and
wounded, 38 of which were officers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A British account of the fight from &ldquo;An Historical
Journal of the Campaigns in North America,&rdquo; London, 1759,
is as follows:</p>
<p>&ldquo;A schooner arrived, from Boston, this morning; by this
vessel we had the satisfaction to receive a bag of letters,
some from Europe, and others from the southward, but none
from the eastward; among those which I got was the following
one, from my friend in the Commander in Chief&rsquo;s army,
dated Albany, July the 29th, 1758.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">41</div>
<p>&lsquo;I scratched a few lines to you, on the 11th instant,
from Fort Edward, and, as I wrote in great pain, I think it
was scarce legible;&mdash;such, as it was, shall be glad to hear it
reached you safe: in a few days after I dispatched it to you,
my fever abated, and I was judged to be out of danger; for
some time, however, it was apprehended I should lose my
arm; as all my baggage remained here since last winter, I
obtained leave to remove to this place, knowing I could be
better accommodated here, than in my confined situation at
Fort Edward: in my last, I promised you a particular account
of our unhappy storm of the 8th instant; it is a mortifying
talk, but you shall be indulged, as I know you are
curious after every occurrence. It will be needless to have
retrospect to any events preceding the 4th of this month,
as there was not any thing remarkable, except preparing
for the expedition, and embarking our provisions, stores,
and artillery; the latter were mounted on floats or rafts,
for the protection of our armament upon the lake, and to
cover us at our landing. On the 5th, the whole army,
amounting to about sixteen thousand men, embarked likewise;
our transports were bateaux and whaleboats, and in
such numbers as to cover the lake for a considerable length
of way, as may well be supposed; we proceeded soon after in
great order, and, as I was in one of the foremost divisions, as
soon as we were put in motion, I think I never beheld so
delightful a prospect. On the 6th, we arrived early in the
morning at the cove, where we were to land: here we
expected some opposition; but a party of light troops having
got on shore, and finding all clear, the whole army landed
without loss of time, formed into columns and marched
immediately; upon our approach, an advanced guard of
the enemy, consisting of several hundred regulars and
savages, who were posted in a strong intrenched camp,
retired very precipitately, after setting fire to their camp,
and destroying almost every thing they had with them;
we continued our march through dark woods and swamps
that were almost impassable, till at length, having lost our
way, the army being obliged to break their order of march,
<span class="pb" id="Page_42">42</span>
we were perplexed, thrown into confusion, and fell in upon
one another, in a most disorderly manner: it was at this
time that Brigadier Lord Howe, being advanced a considerable
way ahead of us, with all the light infantry, and
one of our columns, came up with the before-mentioned
advanced guard of the enemy, who we also suppose to have
lost themselves in their retreat, when a smart skirmish
ensued, in which we were victors, though with some loss;
trifling, however, in comparison to that which the army
sustained by his Lordship&rsquo;s fall, who was killed at the first
charge, and is universally regretted both by officers and
soldiers; the enemy suffered much in this encounter, being
very roughly handled; and we made many men and several
officers prisoners. On the morning of the 7th we marched
back to the landing-place, in order to give the troops time to
rest and refresh themselves, being by this time not a little
harrassed, as may well be conceived: here we incamped, got
a fresh supply of provisions, and boiled our kettles; we had
not been there many hours, when a detachment of the
army (to which I belonged) were sent off under Colonel
Bradstreet, to dispossess the enemy of a post they had at a
saw-mill, about two miles from Ticonderoga; but they did
not wait for us; for, upon receiving intelligence, by their
scouts of our approach, they destroyed the mill, and a
bridge that lay across the river; the latter we soon replaced,
and lay, upon our arms until the evening, when we were
joined by the remainder of the army. I wish I could throw
a veil over what is to follow; for I confess I am at a loss
how to proceed:&mdash;our army was numerous, we were in good
spirits, and, if I may give you my own private opinion, I
believe we were one and all infatuated with a notion of
carrying every obstacle, with so great a force we had, by a
mere Coup de Musqueterie; to such chimerical and romantic
ideas I entirely attribute our great disaster on the 8th, in
which we were confirmed by the report of our chief engineer,
who had reconnoitred the enemy&rsquo;s works, and determined
our fate, by declaring it as his opinion, that it was
very practical to carry them by a general storm; accordingly,
<span class="pb" id="Page_43">43</span>
the army being formed, and every thing in readiness,
we proceeded to the attack, which was as well conducted
and supported as any bold undertaking ever was;&mdash;but
alas! we soon found ourselves grossly deceived;&mdash;the intrenchments
were different from what we had expected,
and were made to believe, their breast-works were uncommonly
high, and the ground in their front, for a great
length of way, was covered with an Abatis de Bois, laid so
close and thick, that their works were really rendered impregnable.
The troops, by the cool and spirited example
of the General, made many eager efforts to no purpose; for
we were so intangled in the branches of the felled trees,
that we could not possibly advance; the enemy were sensible
of this, and remained steady at their breast-works, repeating
their fire, which, from their numbers, was very weighty,
and, from a conviction of their own safety, was served with
great composure. Such was our situation for almost five
hours, when, at length, finding our loss considerable, and
no prospect of carrying our point, we were ordered to desist,
and retire;&mdash;the army retreated to the ground we had
occupied on the preceding night at the sawmill, and the
wounded were sent off to the bateaux without delay, where
the remains of our shattered forces joined us early on the
ninth, and the whole re-embarked, and continued our
retreat to Lake George; there we arrived the same evening
and encamped. That place is computed to be about thirty
miles from Ticonderoga (though I believe it is more) and
fourteen from Fort Edward, whither, as also to this town
(from which I now write) all the wounded were sent the
next day. Our loss is indeed very considerable, as you will
see by the inclosed return. The valiant Colonels Donaldson,
Bever, and Major Proby, with many other of our friends,
I am heartily sorry to acquaint you, are among the slain.
So that what we find so feelingly expressed by the poet
is here fatally verified,</p>

naked, tied to a tree, and preparations were made for burning
him when a French officer interposed. Reaching Ticonderoga,
he was examined by the Marquis de Montcalm and
sent to Montreal as a prisoner. Afterwards exchanged, he
lived to have a distinguished career in the Revolution.</p>

<br /><span class="sc">The Amherst Campaign</span></h2>
<p>The next year, 1759, General Jeffrey Amherst, who had
succeeded General Abercromby, again advanced down Lake
George to attack the Fort. On July 21st with 5743 British
regulars and about the same number of provincials he left
Fort William Henry. In the meantime, the French garrison
at Ticonderoga had been much reduced. Montcalm had
gone to the defense of Quebec, leaving General Bourlamaque,
who had been slightly wounded the year before, in
command. Amherst&rsquo;s army followed Abercromby&rsquo;s route
but instead of attacking proceeded to invest the Fort. Bourlamaque
soon realized that he would be starved out and
captured within a reasonable time, so, after a few days
defense decided to evacuate. He left Captain Hebecourt
with 400 of the garrison and with the balance retreated to
Crown Point and eventually to Isle aux Noix. Hebecourt
kept up a heavy artillery fire as the British advanced
through the French lines and threw up counter defenses.
Amherst was then within 600 yards of the Fort. He did
not know that Bourlamaque had retreated with most of
the French Army. On the 3rd night Hebecourt embarked
the balance of his force, set fire to the Fort and left a
lighted match headed for the powder magazine, which was
located in the South East Bastion. The Fort was soon in
flames and the magazine blew up with a tremendous
explosion. Hebecourt made good his retreat to Isle aux
Noix where he joined Bourlamaque.</p>
<p>An excellent description of the taking of the Fort by
Amherst is contained in a letter from a Massachusetts
soldier, Eli Forbush, in the Museum collection. It follows
herewith:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very Rev&rsquo;d &amp; Hon&rsquo;d Sr.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tis an old saying better late than never, therefore I
presume (tho too unseasonably) to wait upon you with a
line, to tell you what God has done for us the army and his
Chh [Church] and people in gen&rsquo;l. On ye 21 of July ye army
imbarked for this place, which consisted of 11756, the Invincible
rydau sail&rsquo;d in ye rear of grenadiers, light infantry
and rangers, and in ye front of remaining army and ye
sloop Halifax brought up ye rear of ye whole. The fleet
reached Sabbath Day Point by day light, then the Invincible
came to anchor, and ye whole Fleet lay upon ye ores, till
break of day, when ye signal was given for sailing, and the
whole landed without opposition, between ye hours of nine
and eleven, 22d, the light infantry, rangers, and grenad&rsquo;rs
marched immediately for the mill, where they found the
<span class="pb" id="Page_49">49</span>
enemy posted, in three advantageous places, but as soon
as they saw the dexterity and resolution of our advancing
parties, they fled and left ye grounds in our possession and
as our people got ye first fire and received only a running
fire from them, little execution was done on either side,
we obtain 3 prisoners and kild 3 on ye spot, and received
only a slight wound or two from them. The whole army
marched forward, beside what was necessary to guard the
landing place, with ye vessels and stores, some were imployed
in persuing the enemy, some in clearing the roads,
and ye water course from ye mill, others in taking possession
of all ye most advantageous ground near ye Fort&mdash;the
whole was performed with ye greatest regularity, ye least
noise, a noble calmness and intrepid resolution, ye whole
army seemed to pertake of ye very soul of ye commander.
As ye enemy had not force nor courage to man ye lines yt
provd so fatal to our brave troops last year, we took possession
of them without much opposition, and before day
of ye 23d began to intrench and ye body of ye army incamped
behind ye breastwork, which covered them from
ye enemies fire, as soon as it was light and ye enemy perceived
our disposition, they raised a smart canonade upon
us, but without effect, those that were intrenching, between
ye Breastwork and ye Fort had by this time covered
ymselves, and ye breastwork was a defence to ye camp,
they continued to canonade and to throw yr shells, and
we continued to intrench, advancing nearer and nearer, the
Gen&rsquo;l ordered yt no fire shd be returned upon ye enemy
(except in case of necessary defence) till he had all ye
batteries ready to open at once, and as ye trenches were
long ye digging bad, the whole could not be compleated
till Thursday night ye 26 or rather Fryday morning ye 27.
When ye batteries were to be opened at once, the enemy
seemed fully sensible of ye fatal consequences of such heavy
batteries for a little after midnight between ye 26 &amp; 27.
they blew up ye magazine and made off, some by land on
ye east side of ye lake and some by water with all yt they
could carry (which could be but a little), nineteen of those
<span class="pb" id="Page_50">50</span>
that went off by land got lost and came into our camp
next morning, some of ye light infantry yt were posted on ye
left by ye lake side hearing ye enemies boats fire several
cannon loaded with grape in among ym which greatly dismad
and destresd them,&mdash;we found 3 of ye boats adrift
loaded with powder and other stores, others broke and
sunk.</p>

ye most sanguine imagination, nature and art are
Joind to render it impregnable, and had not ye enemy behaved

<br /><span class="sc">The Calm Before The Storm</span></h2>
<p>From 1759 to 1775 it was peaceful and tranquil at
Ticonderoga. There are but few records, though the British
maintained a garrison at the Fort and also one at Crown
Point. The Fort was used as a storehouse for military
supplies, and presumably the garrison did its best to entertain
itself in what was then a wilderness. Major Gavin
Cochrane commanded for four years, and in 1765 Major
Thomas James went down from Ticonderoga to New York
to aid in enforcing the Stamp Act. On February 15th,
1767, Lieutenant-Governor Carleton wrote from Montreal
to Major General Gage:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The forts of Crown Point and Ticonderoga are in a
very declining condition ... should you approve of keeping
up these posts, it will be best to repair them as soon as
possible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Crown Point caught on fire in April, 1773, and a large
part of the barracks was destroyed by an explosion in the
magazine. Detachments of the 60th Regiment, the Royal
American Regiment of Foot, was stationed here for many
years, and Major General Haldimand spent a short time at
the Fort. Early in 1775 Major Philip Skene of Skenesborough
was appointed Lieutenant-Governor of Crown Point
and Ticonderoga. However, as he was captured on his return
from England the same year and confined as a Loyalist,
(though afterwards exchanged and was with Burgoyne in
1777) he could not have done very much Lieutenant-Governoring.</p>

<p class="pcap"><span class="sc">Ethan Allen</span></p>
</div>
<h2 id="c7"><span class="small">CHAPTER SEVEN</span>
<br /><span class="sc">Ethan Allen</span></h2>
<p>In 1775, while the trouble in Boston was brewing,
Samuel Holden Parsons, Colonel Samuel Wyllys and Silas
Deane, all of Connecticut, and probably at the suggestion
of Colonel John Brown of Pittsfield, Massachusetts, conceived
the idea of seizing Ticonderoga and capturing the great
quantities of military supplies known to be stored in the
Fort.</p>
<p>The Colony of Massachusetts voted a considerable sum
and Colonel Benedict Arnold was authorized to raise a
force and seize the fort. About the same time, however,
Ethan Allen, leader of a body of irregular troops known
as the Green Mountain Boys, also conceived the idea. Allen
and Arnold met in Castleton, Vermont, and both claimed
the command. The Green Mountain Boys absolutely refused
<span class="pb" id="Page_55">55</span>
to serve under anyone but Allen. Eventually a compromise
was made and a joint command agreed on. A rendezvous
was agreed on in Hand&rsquo;s Cove on the east side of Lake
Champlain about two miles north of the Fort and on the
night of May 9th about 350 men had gathered. There was
a scarcity of boats, however, and the few obtainable were
rowed back and forth all night, landing just north of the
present Fort Ticonderoga Ferry. Shortly before daylight
only 83 men and a number of officers had reached the west
shore. Not daring to postpone the attack, Allen proceeded
by the wood road then running across the swamp which
formerly existed in what is now the North Field. His own
account of the capture is as follows:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I landed eighty-three men near the garrison, and sent
the boats back for the rear guard commanded by Col.
Seth Warner; but the day began to dawn, and I found
myself under a necessity to attack the fort, before the rear
could cross the lake; and, as it was viewed hazardous, I
harangued the officers and soldiers in the manner following:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Friends and fellow soldiers, you have, for a number
of years past, been a scourge and terror to arbitrary power.
Your valour has been famed abroad, and acknowledged, as
appears by the advice and orders to me (from the general
assembly of Connecticut) to surprise and take the garrison
now before us. I now propose to advance before you, and
in person conduct you through the wicket-gate; for we must
this morning either quit our pretensions to valour, or possess
ourselves of this fortress in a few minutes; and, in as much
as it is a desperate attempt, (which none but the bravest of
men dare undertake) I do not urge it on any contrary to
his will. You that will undertake voluntarily poise your
firelocks.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The men being (at this time) drawn up in three ranks,
each poised his firelock. I ordered them to face to the
right; and, at the head of the centre-file, marched them
immediately to the wicket-gate aforesaid, where I found a
<span class="pb" id="Page_56">56</span>
centry posted, who instantly snapped his fusee at me; I ran
immediately toward him, and he retreated through the
covered way into the parade within the garrison, gave a
halloo, and ran under a bomb-proof. My party who followed
me into the fort, I formed on the parade in such a manner
as to face the two barracks which faced each other. The
garrison being asleep, (except the centries) we gave three
huzzas which greatly surprised them. One of the centries
made a pass at one of my officers with charged bayonet
and slightly wounded him: My first thought was to kill
him with my sword; but, in an instant, altered the design
and fury of the blow to a slight cut on the side of the
head; upon which he dropped his gun, and asked quarter,
which I readily granted him, and demanded of him the
place where the commanding officer slept; he showed me
a pair of stairs in the front of a barrack, on the west part
of the garrison, which led up to a second story in said
barrack, to which I immediately repaired, and ordered the
commander (Capt. Delaplace) to come forth instantly, or
I would sacrifice the whole garrison; at which the capt.
came immediately to the door with his breeches in his
hand, when I ordered him to deliver to me the fort instantly,
who asked me by what authority I demanded it; I answered,
&lsquo;In the name of the great Jehovah, and the Continental
Congress.&rsquo; (The authority of the Congress being very little
known at that time) he began to speak again; but I interrupted
him, and with my drawn sword over his head,
again demanded an immediate surrender of the garrison;
to which he then complied, and ordered his men to be
forthwith paraded without arms, as he had given up the
garrison; in the meantime some of my officers had given
orders, and in consequence thereof, sundry of the barrack
doors were beat down, and about one-third of the garrison
imprisoned, which consisted of the said commander, a Lieut.
Feltham, a conductor of artillery, a gunner, two serjeants,
and forty-four rank and file; about one hundred pieces of
cannon, one 13 inch mortar, and a number of swivels. This
surprise was carried into execution in the gray of the
morning of the 10th day of May, 1775. The sun seemed
to rise that morning with a superior lustre; and Ticonderoga
and its dependencies smiled on its conquerors, who
tossed about the flowing bowl, and wished success to Congress,
and liberty and freedom of America.&rdquo; The flowing
bowl evidently had its effect as Allen&rsquo;s first account of the
capture of the Fort reads as follows:</p>

</div>
<p>To the Massachusetts Council,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gentlemen: I have to inform you, with pleasure unfelt
before, that on the break of day of the tenth of May, 1775,
by the order of the General Assembly of the Colony of
Connecticut, I took the fortress of Ticonderoga by storm.
The soldiery was composed of about one hundred Green
Mountain Boys and nearly fifty veteran soldiers from the
Province of Massachusetts Bay. The latter was under command
of Colonel James Easton, who behaved with great
zeal and fortitude,&mdash;not only in council; but in the assault.
The soldiery behaved with such resistless fury, that they
<span class="pb" id="Page_58">58</span>
so terrified the Kings troops, that they durst not fire on
their assailants, and our soldiery was agreeably disappointed.
The soldiery behaved with uncommon rancour when they
leaped into the Fort; and it must be confessed, that the
Colonel has greatly contributed to the taking of that fortress,
as well as John Brown, Esq., attorney at law, who was also
an able counsellor, and was personally in the attack. I expect
the Colonies will maintain this fort. As to the cannon and
war-like stores, I hope they may serve the cause of liberty
instead of tyranny, and I humbly implore your assistance
in immediately assisting the Government of Connecticut
in establishing a garrison in the reduced premises. Colonel
Easton will inform you at large. From, gentlemen, your
most obedient, humble servant.</p>
<p><span class="lr">Ethan Allen&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>On the 12th, however, he sent a more temperate
account to the Governor of Connecticut, the original manuscript
of which is now in the Fort Library and reads as
follows:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hon&rsquo;ble Sir: I make you a present of a Major, a
Captain, and two Lieutenants in the regular Establishment
of George the Third. I hope they may serve as ransoms
for some of our friends at Boston, and particularly for
Captain Brown of Rhode Island. A party of men, under
the command of Capt. Herrick, has took possession of
Skenesborough, imprisoned Major Skene, and seized a
schooner of his. I expect, in ten days time, to have it rigged,
manned and armed, with six or eight pieces of cannon, which,
with the boats in our possession, I purpose to make an attack
on the armed sloop of George the Third, which is now cruising
on Lake Champlain, and is about twice as big as the schooner.
I hope in a short time to be authorized to acquaint your
Honour, that Lake Champlain, and the fortifications thereon,
are subject to the Colonies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The enterprise has been approbated by the officers
and soldiery of the Green Mountains boys, nor do I hesitate
as to the success. I expect lives must be lost in the attack,
as the commander of George&rsquo;s sloop is a man of courage, etc.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">59</div>
<p>&ldquo;Messrs. Hickock, Halsey and Nichols have the charge
of conducting the officers to Hartford. These gentlemen
have been very assiduous and active in the late expedition.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I depend upon your Honour&rsquo;s aid and assistance in
a situation so contiguous to Canada.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I subscribe myself, your Honour&rsquo;s ever faithful, Most
obedient and humble servant.</p>
<p><span class="lr">Ethan Allen</span></p>

<p>It is interesting to note that in neither of Allen&rsquo;s reports
does he mention Arnold, who had a joint command with
him. Hard feeling between the two commanders had
already developed. Arnold was a commissioned officer in
the Connecticut Militia and Allen, an amateur. Professional
soldiers and amateurs never have hit it off.</p>

<h3>THE BRITISH SIDE OF THE CAPTURE</h3>
<p>A few years ago Mr. Allen French discovered the
manuscript of Lieutenant Feltham&rsquo;s report, which reads as
follows:</p>
<p><span class="lr">New York, June 11th 1775.</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir</p>
<p>&ldquo;Capt. Delaplace of the 26th regt has given me directions
to lay before you in as plain a narrative as I can the
manner of the surprizal of the fort of Ticonderoga on 10th
May with all the circumstances after it that I thought might
be of any service in giving you Exy any light into the affair.</p>

</div>
<p>&ldquo;Capt. Delaplace having in the course of the winter
applied to Gen. Carleton for a reinforcement, as he had
reason to suspect some attack from some circumstances that
happend&rsquo;d in his neighborhood, Gen Carleton was pleased to
order a detachment of a subaltern and 20 men to be sent
in two or three separate parties the first party of which
was sent as a crew along with Major Dunbar who left
Canada about the 12th April, I being the first subaltern on
command was ordered down with 10 men in a few days
more, to give up to Capt Delaplace with whom Lt Wadman
was to remain, having receiv&rsquo;d orders from the regt some
time before to join there. as he was not arrived when I
came I had orders to wait until he did. I was 12 days there
before he came which was about an hour after the fort was
surprised. I had not lain in the fort on my arrival having
left the only tolerable rooms there for Mr. Wadman if he
arrived with his family, but being unwell, had lain in the
fort for two or three nights preceding the 10th May, on
which morning about half an hour after three in my sleep
I was awaken&rsquo;d by numbers of shreiks, &amp; the words no
quarter, no quarter from a number of arm&rsquo;d rabble I
jump&rsquo;d up about which time I heard the noise continue in
the area of the fort I ran undress&rsquo;d to knock at Capt. Delaplaces
door &amp; to receive his orders or wake him, the door
was fast the room I lay in being close to Capt Delaplace
I stept back, put on my coat &amp; waist coat &amp; return&rsquo;d to
his room, there being no possibility of getting to the men as
there were numbers of the rioters on the bastions of the
wing of the fort on which the door of my room and back
door of Capt Delaplaces room led, with great difficulty, I
got into his room, being pursued, from which there was a
door down by stairs in to the area of the fort, I ask&rsquo;d Capt
Delaplace who was by now just up what I should do, &amp;
offer&rsquo;d to force my way if possible to our men, on opening
this door the bottom of the stairs was filld with the rioters
&amp; many were forcing their way up, knowing the Commg
Officer lived there, as they had broke open the lower rooms
<span class="pb" id="Page_64">64</span>
where the officers live in winter, and could not find them
there, from the top of the stairs I endeavour&rsquo;d to make
them hear me, but it was impossible, on making a signal not
to come up the stairs, they stop&rsquo;d, &amp; proclaimd silence
among themselves, I then address&rsquo;d them, but in a stile not
agreeable to them I ask&rsquo;d them a number of questions,
expecting to amuse them till our people fired which I must
certainly own I thought would have been the case, after
asking them the most material questions, I could think
viz by what authority they entered his majesties fort who
were the leaders and what their intent &amp;c &amp;c I was informd
by one Ethan Allen and one Benedict Arnold that they had
a joint command, Arnold informing me he came from instructions
recd from the congress at Cambridge which he
afterwards shew&rsquo;d me. Mr. Allen told me his orders were
from the province of Connecticut &amp; that he must have immediate
possession of the fort and all the effects of George
the third (those were his words) Mr. Allen insisting on this
with a drawn sword over my head &amp; numbers of his
followers firelocks presented at me alledging I was commanding
officer &amp; to give up the fort, and if it was not
comply&rsquo;d with, or that there was a single gun fired in the
fort neither man woman or child should be left alive in
the fort. Mr. Arnold begg&rsquo;d it in a genteel manner but without
success, it was owing to him they were prevented getting
into Capt Delaplaces room, after they found I did not
command. Capt. Delaplace being now dress&rsquo;d came out,
when after talking to him some time, they put me back
into the room they placed two sentry&rsquo;s on me and took
Capt Delaplace down stairs they also placed sentrys at the
back door, from the beginning of the noise till half an hour
after this I never saw a Soldier, tho&rsquo; I heard a great noise
in their rooms and can not account otherwise than that they
must have been seiz&rsquo;d in their beds before I got on the stairs,
or at the first coming in, which must be the case as Allen
wounded one of the guard on his struggling with him in the
guard room immediately after his entrance into the fort.
When I did see our men they were drawn up without arms,
<span class="pb" id="Page_65">65</span>
which were all put into one room over which they placed
sentrys and allotted one to each soldier their strength at
first coming that is the number they had ferry&rsquo;d over in the
night amounted to about 90 but from their entrance &amp;
shouting they were constantly landing men till about 10
o&rsquo;clock when I suppose there were about 300, &amp; by the
next morning at least another 100 who I suppose were waiting
the event &amp; came now to join in the plunder which was
most rigidly perform&rsquo;d as to liquor, provisions, &amp;c whether
belonging to his majesty or private property, about noon on
the 10th May, our men were sent to the landing at L.
George, &amp; sent over next day, then march&rsquo;d by Albany to
Hartford Connecticut where they arrived on the 22d they
would not allow an Officer to go with them tho&rsquo; I requested
it. They sent Capt Delaplace his Lady, family &amp; Lt Wadman
&amp; myself by Skenesborough to Hartford where we arrived
the 21st.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shortly after Allen&rsquo;s capture of the Fort Congress decided
to garrison the place, and what was afterwards called
the Northern Army was concentrated there. It consisted
mostly of New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania troops
with the Pennsylvanians the best equipped and organized.
General Philip Schuyler of New York was in command
through 1775. The Fort was repaired and the old French
Lines strengthened and a number of redoubts started.</p>

<br /><span class="sc">Montgomery, Knox, Valcour Island</span></h2>
<p>A number of important things happened at Ticonderoga
during the American occupation between Allen&rsquo;s
capture, May 10th, 1775, and St. Clair&rsquo;s evacuation before
Burgoyne, July 6, 1777.</p>
<p>An expedition for the invasion of Canada was planned.
By the middle of July, 1775, General Schuyler arrived at
Ticonderoga and found but little progress had been made to
advance the expedition, few bateaux, no boards, little
material and few workmen able to build boats. He repaired
the French sawmill, sawed boards, requisitioned carpenters,
nails, provisions and teams and forwarded matters with so
much dispatch that by the beginning of August regiments
which were to form the army began to move toward Ticonderoga.
The Continental troops began to arrive by the
middle of August, and on the 13th General Richard Montgomery
arrived and reviewed the troops. On the 28th
the army advanced and after a few skirmishes on the way
reached St. Johns on the 6th of September. The army consisted
of about 1000 men under command of General Philip
Schuyler, almost wholly Connecticut troops excepting about
250 of the first battalion of New Yorkers, under command
of Lieutenant Colonel Ritzma. On the 13th of September
General Schuyler was forced to return to Ticonderoga on
account of illness, leaving General Richard Montgomery in
command. The fort at St. Johns held out until November
2nd, when the garrison surrendered to the American invaders.
Among the officers who surrendered and who were sent
down to Ticonderoga, a prisoner with the rest was Lieutenant
John Andre, afterwards executed as a spy.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_69">69</div>
<p>On Monday morning, November 13th, a detachment
from the Continental Army took possession of Montreal.
Unfortunately, the time of many of the Connecticut troops
had expired and most of them decided to go home. The
General offered as a bounty for those who would enlist for
only five months, a watch great coat, coat, jacket and
breeches, stockings and shoes, shirt, caps, mittens, socks and
an English Crown. About 200 volunteered to stay.</p>
<p>General Montgomery shortly afterwards joined Benedict
Arnold who was besieging Quebec, and lost his life in the
unsuccessful attack on that place. The remnants of two
armies reached Ticonderoga in the spring of 1776 in a
terrible condition.</p>
<p>It was while serving under General Montgomery that
Ethan Allen, advancing toward Montreal to ascertain
whether the Canadians were with or against the Americans,
was captured, sent to England as a prisoner and not returned
and released until May, 1778. He took no further part in
the Revolution, though Congress granted him the rank and
pay of a colonel.</p>
<p>On the 16th of November General Washington sent
the following instruction to Henry Knox, then a Colonel of
Artillery:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are immediately to examine into the state of the
artillery of this army, and take an account of the cannon,
mortars, shells, lead and ammunition that are wanting.
When you have done that you are to proceed in the most
expeditious manner to New York, there to apply to the
President of the Provincial Congress and learn of him
whether Colonel Reed did anything or left any orders respecting
these things, and get him to procure such of
them as can possibly be had there. The president, if he
can, will have them immediately sent hither; if he cannot,
you must put them in a proper channel to be transported
to this camp with despatch before you leave New York.
After you have procured as many of these necessaries as
you can there, you must go to Major-General Schuyler and
get the remainder from Ticonderoga, Crown Point, or St.
John; if it should be necessary, from Quebec, if in our hands.
The want of them is so great that no trouble or expense
must be spared to obtain them. I have wrote to General
Schuyler, he will give every necessary assistance, that they
may be had and forwarded to this place with the utmost
despatch. I have given you a warrant to the Paymaster
General of the Continental Army for a thousand dollars, to
defray the expense attending your journey and procuring
these articles, an account of which you are to keep and render
upon your return.</p>

<p class="tb">The Continental Army, approximately 16,000 men, was
besieging Boston, but without heavy artillery it would be
impossible to force the British out. Apparently Colonel
Knox had submitted a plan to Washington for the removal
of the guns from Ticonderoga.</p>
<p>On the 5th of December Knox reached Ticonderoga
and by the 6th was busy removing heavy guns from the
Fort to a gondola, a type of flat-bottomed boat used on the
lake. By the 9th they had all been transported to the
carrying-place and were loaded on the scows to take them
to the head of Lake George. With the greatest difficulty
he transported them over-land, having had made forty-two
strong sleds and hired eighty-one yoke of oxen. Not until
January 4th did the first brass 24 pounder reach Albany,
and on the 24th of the same month with his &ldquo;noble train
of artillery,&rdquo; he arrived at the camp in Cambridge. It was
a great undertaking considering the roads and bridges of
the period.</p>

<p>In the spring of 1776, Benedict Arnold returned to
Ticonderoga from the unsuccessful siege of Quebec. His
spies soon told him that the British under Sir Guy Carleton
intended to invade from the North. Arnold, one of the
best soldiers this country ever has produced, realized that
a fleet on Lake Champlain should be the first line of defense.
With super-human efforts he collected shipwrights and
carpenters at Ticonderoga and Skenesborough, erected ways,
and, in spite of the lack of men and money, by the end of
August the fleet was ready. It consisted of:</p>

entirely destroyed, but Arnold had accomplished his object,
he had held back the invaders for a whole year, as by the
time Sir Guy Carleton reached and took Crown Point it
was too late for his army to advance.</p>

<br /><span class="sc">Burgoyne Takes the Fort and Brown Fails to Retake It</span></h2>
<p>The winter of 1776-1777 was a terrible one. The sufferings
among the troops at Ticonderoga exceeded anything
at Valley Forge. Men were frozen to death in their tents,
smallpox broke out in the spring and altogether it was almost
unbearable. General Gates succeeded General Schuyler as
commander-in-chief of the Northern Army. Anthony Wayne
was succeeded by Arthur St. Clair as commander at Ticonderoga,
in the spring of 1777 and took command of 2500
Continental troops and 900 militia. General John Burgoyne
had succeeded Sir Guy Carleton as commander-in-chief
of the British Army in Canada.</p>
<p>With the destruction of the American Fleet at Valcour
Island the autumn before, there was nothing to stop the
advance of the British, and their army moved south up Lake
Champlain in a great flotilla of bateaux and little sailing
vessels. A large part of the American army was concentrated
at Mount Independence directly across the lake from Ticonderoga
and a floating bridge had been built connecting the
two posts.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_84">84</div>

<p class="pcap"><span class="sc">General John Burgoyne</span></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_85">85</div>
<p>Early in July Burgoyne invested the defenses on the
New York side of the lake. John Trumbull in 1776 had suggested
the fortifying of Mount Defiance which commanded
the Fort, but it was never done. On July 5th the British
succeeded in drawing a battery of guns to the top and opened
up on the Fort. General St. Clair decided to retreat by way
of the bridge and Mount Independence, the only road open.
The retreat was well conceived, but someone set fire to General
de Fermoy&rsquo;s house and the British outposts discovered the
American army retreating. A rear guard had been left at
the Mount Independence end of the bridge, but unfortunately,
they found a cask of wine and when the British
succeeded in repairing and crossing the bridge, the whole
guard was hors de combat. Part of the Americans retreated
toward Skenesborough, the Whitehall of today, in the few
gondolas and row galleys that had escaped the defeat at
Valcour Island the year before. Most of the army, however,
marched east toward Castleton. The British soon cut the
boom which had been thrown across the lake from Willow
Point to the Vermont shore and part of their army went on
up the lake by water after the fleeing Americans. General
Fraser pursued the retreating army and overtook the American
rear guard under Seth Warner near Hubbardton. A
sharp engagement took place and the Americans were defeated,
losing 324 in killed and wounded. It was the German
troops under Baron Riedesel, who, coming into the action
a little late, forced the Americans from the field. On July
6th some of the British ships pursued the American galleys
as far as Whitehall, then Skenesborough, and captured two
of them, forcing the Americans to blow up the remainder.
Burgoyne left a garrison at Ticonderoga under General
Powell and proceeded to follow out his plan of taking
northern New York and meeting General Howe at Albany.</p>
<p>St. Clair was courtmartialed for retreating but was exonerated
as it was the only thing he could have done under
the circumstances. In the meantime the army from Ticonderoga
formed the nucleus that eventually, having received
an enormous number of recruits from New York, Vermont
and New Hampshire, forced the capitulation of Burgoyne
and the surrender of his whole army at Saratoga late in
the autumn. It was Burgoyne&rsquo;s bombastic proclamation
to the settlers to be loyal to the King, or he would unloose
his Indians, coupled with the unfortunate murder of Jane McCrea
by some of his Indians, which aroused the countryside.</p>
<p>A determined attempt to recapture the Fort was made
by Colonel John Brown, the same Brown who probably was
the originator of the capture by Allen two years before.
He was supported by Colonel Johnson whose duty it was
to take Mount Independence and by Captain Ebenezer
Allen, whose job it was to capture Mount Defiance. The
attack was by way of the foot of Lake George and his own
account reads as follows:</p>

<p>Sir; with great fatigue after marching all last night I
arrived at this place at the break of day, after the best disposition
of the men I could make, immediately began the
attack, and in a few minutes carried the place. I then
without any loss of time detached a considerable part of
my men to the mills, where a greater number of the enemy
were posted, who also were soon made prisoners, a small
number of them having taken possession of a blockhouse in
that vicinity were with more difficulty bro&rsquo;t to submission;
but at a sight of a cannon they surrendered. During this
season of success, Mount Defiance also fell into our hands.
I have taken possession of the old French lines at Ticonderoga,
and have sent a flag demanding the surrender of
Ty and of mount independence in strong and peremptory
terms. I have had as yet no information of Col. Johnson&rsquo;s
attack on the mount. My loss of men in these several actions
are not more than 3 or 4 killed and 5 wounded, the enemy&rsquo;s
loss is less. I find myself in possession of 293 prisoners, viz,
2 captains, 9 subs, 2 commisaries, non Commissioned officers
and privates, 143 British, 119 Canadians, 18 artificers, and
retook more than 100 of our men, total 293, exclusive of
the prisoners retaken&mdash;The watercraft I have taken is 150
bateaus below the falls on Lake Champlain 50 above the
falls including 17 gunboats and one armed sloop, arms equal
to the number of prisoners. Some ammunition and many
other things which I cannot now ascertain. I must not
forget to mention a few cannon which may be of great
service to us. Tho my success has hitherto answered most
sanguine expectations, I cannot promise myself great things,
the events of war being so dubious in their nature, but shall
do my best to distress the enemy all in my power,&mdash;having
regard to my retreat&mdash;There is but a small quantity of
provisions at this place which I think will necessitate my
retreat in case we do not carry Ty and independence&mdash;I
hope you will use your utmost endeavor to give me assistance
should I need in crossing the lake &amp;c&mdash;The enemy has but
a very small force at Fort George. Their boats are on an
island about 14 miles from this guarded by six companies,
having artillery&mdash;I have much fear with respect to the
prisoners, being obliged to send them under a small guard&mdash;I
am well informed that considerable reinforcements is
hourly expected at the lake under command of Sir John

<p>In 1781 Ira and Ethan Allen were negotiating with the
British authorities as to the feasibility of making Vermont a
Canadian province. Congress had refused to admit Vermont
as the fourteenth state and were considering dividing
it between New York and New Hampshire. Rather than
submit to this the Allens and Governor Chittenden opened
negotiations with Lieutenant-Governor Haldimand of
Canada, the object of which was probably to force Congress
to act in their favor, and they succeeded.</p>
<p>In July, 1783, General George Washington, accompanied
by Governor Clinton, Col. Alexander Hamilton and others,
visited the Fort on a tour of inspection, returning to the
headquarters at Newburgh on the 5th of August.</p>
<p>Shortly after the treaty of peace between Great Britain
and the United States was signed the whole country began
to be rapidly settled. No guard was kept at Ticonderoga
and it provided a convenient quarry for the early settlers.
All the furniture and movable objects were taken first, then
the doors and windows, floors were ripped up and the
great beams removed, and in a short time the barracks
collapsed. Even the abandoned cannon, most of them spiked,
were removed to be melted up for their iron.</p>

<br /><span class="sc">The Restoration of Fort Ticonderoga</span>
<br /><span class="small">by John H. G. Pell</span></h2>
<p>After the Revolution, all crown lands reverted not to
the national government, but to the States in which they
were situated. The Garrison Grounds at Fort Ticonderoga
and other pieces were designated by the State of New York
for educational purposes on March 31, 1790. On Sept. 12,
1803, the Garrison Grounds were deeded to Columbia and
Union Colleges jointly by the State.</p>
<p>William Ferris Pell, a New York business man, spent
these years in Burlington, Vermont. He made many trips
between Canada, Burlington and New York. While traveling
up and down Lake Champlain he was struck by the
beauty of the point of land on which the Fort stands, and
the romantic interest of the ruins of the Fort. He determined
to build a house there, if ever able to do so.</p>
<p>Returning to New York he organized the firm of Pells
and Company, importers of mahogany and marble. This
firm flourished for a hundred years. Mr. Pell leased the
property from Columbia and Union Colleges and shortly
thereafter built a house which he called &ldquo;Beaumont.&rdquo; The
house was situated below the Fort between the garden laid
out by the French officers in 1756 and the shores of Lake
Champlain. Mr. Pell was much interested in horticulture
and he restored the old garden and imported many plants
from Europe and from the nurseries on Long Island to embellish
and beautify it.</p>
<p>In 1820, he undertook to secure the deeds to the Garrison
grounds and they were purchased by him from Union
College on July 28, 1820 and from Columbia College on
September 4, 1820.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_95">95</div>
<p>In addition to building a house and replanting the
garden, he tried to stop the depredations which were occurring
to the Fort. The two buildings that were standing after
the Revolution, the South and West Barracks, were ruined
by the early settlers, who removed everything movable&mdash;doors,
windows, floor boards, etc., and eventually the very
beams themselves. Thousands of loads of stone were carted
away for foundations. Some men had repaired the French
lime kiln and were burning the walls of the Fort for lime.
Mr. Pell had to buy up the numerous squatters&rsquo; rights but
he eventually succeeded in stopping the destruction. He
fenced in various earthworks and redoubts to prevent them
being plowed under and did his best to preserve what was
left. He was a man of vision. Had it not been for William
Ferris Pell and those who came after him not a stone in Fort
Ticonderoga would be in place today. Every one would
have been carted away or destroyed.</p>
<p>In 1825, &ldquo;Beaumont&rdquo; burned and in 1826, he built
&ldquo;The Pavilion&rdquo; which is still standing and occupied by his
descendants. &ldquo;The Pavilion&rdquo; was built on the edge of &ldquo;Le
Jardin du Roi,&rdquo; a garden laid out by Captain de Pontleroy,
an engineer officer stationed here during the French occupation,
and renamed &ldquo;The King&rsquo;s Garden&rdquo; by the British,
which name it has borne ever since. Mr. Pell spent his
summers here. His oldest son, Archibald, had decided to be
a gentleman farmer and took over the management of the
place, but was killed by the explosion of a cannon he was
firing as a salute to his father who was coming up the
Lake, April 19th, 1838. Thereafter William Ferris Pell could
not bear to live at his beloved Ticonderoga. He died intestate
and no will was ever found, but he was a good business
man and it is unlikely that he failed to make a will, but
safe deposit boxes were unknown in that day and wills were
kept in desks. Family tradition is that one of his sons found
and read the will, was dissatisfied with his share, and
destroyed it. At any rate, the property then passed in equal
shares to his ten children. None of them could afford to
keep up &ldquo;The Pavilion,&rdquo; so it was rented to various people
who ran it as a boarding house and hotel for many years.
However, seldom a summer went by without some member
of the family spending time at &ldquo;The Pavilion,&rdquo; James
Kent Pell, son of William Ferris, managed the property for
his brothers and sisters for many years and struggled to
preserve it. He was shocked on coming up one summer
to find that the breast-high wall running from the Fort to
the lake, and a large part of the Pontleroy and Germain
Redoubts had been carted to the lake front and thrown in
for a steamboat landing. The farmer in charge said that
the contractor told him he had permission. It was too late
to do anything about it.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_97">97</div>
<p>When James Pell died, John Howland Pell, a grandson,
managed it for some time and later Howland Pell, a great-grandson,
ran the property for a great many years. Howland
always hoped that some member of the family would
some day take it over and if it had not been for Howland
it would have passed out of the family. Some people offered
almost as much as the whole property was worth for fifty
acres between the Fort and the West shore of the Lake.
They wished to build a hotel, but he refused to sell.</p>
<p>Towards the end of the century, Stephen Pell, a little
boy of eight and his brother, Howland, were sent up to visit
their grandmother who was spending the summer at Fort
Ticonderoga at &ldquo;The Pavilion&rdquo; which was then rented as a
hotel. Filled with self importance at being intrusted with
tickets and money for such a long trip alone, the boys finally
arrived at Fort Ticonderoga. It is not hard to imagine how
the Fort at once captured their interest. Little boys of eight
and ten have vivid imaginations and with a doting grandmother
who told delightfully the old tales of capture and
recapture, these imaginations soon ran riot. They were in
turn Montcalm, Allen, Arnold, Burgoyne (always a successful
officer). They ran up the hills and over the walls, demanding
the surrender, or holding the fort. Thrill of thrills
came one day when Stephen found the bronze flint box,
containing a flint. It is typical of little boys that an argument
resulted&mdash;Howland claiming that it was half his as he
had dislodged the stone, under which it lay, as he climbed
up the hill. It was a beautiful little box that had belonged
to a man of means and of distinction. One can see them
standing there after the first raptures of finding it were
over, eyes shining, picturing the Fort in all its past glory,
with the proud walls standing, the flags flying and men in
bright uniforms on the parade grounds. The lives of men
are swayed by seemingly unimportant things and in Stephen
Pell&rsquo;s life always there was the little flint box and the
youthful dream. As he grew older the imagination became
an obsession, and the obsession became reality as stone by
stone, timber by timber, wall by wall, he repaired and restored
the Fort until it stands the old Fort Ticonderoga, all
built from a flint box, a little boy&rsquo;s vivid imagination and a
man&rsquo;s hard work, research and intelligence.</p>

by American Troops, swallowed the bullet. He

preserved in the Tallmadge family and presented

Henry O. Tallmadge, Esq.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_99">99</div>
<p>The important contribution of the Pell family during
a period approaching 150 years has been an appreciation of
historical values and a sense of responsibility towards them.
There has always been at least one member of the family
who refused to allow any part of the property sold, who
kept up the gardens and planted trees and who, above all,
cherished and preserved the Fort.</p>
<p>In 1908, Mr. and Mrs. Stephen Pell decided to rehabilitate
the &ldquo;Pavilion&rdquo; and spend their summers in it so that
Mr. Pell could undertake the restoration of the Fort. There
were legal, financial, architectural, political and engineering
problems, and just plain problems. There was a horse
living in one of the rooms of the &ldquo;Pavilion.&rdquo; There was of
course no plumbing, central heating or electricity in the
house. The land belonged to 17 members of the family and
the problem of locating them and arranging satisfactory
terms of purchase was a long and complicated one. There
were squatters living all along the shores of Lake Champlain,
and these squatters had acquired squatters&rsquo; rights.
Nevertheless, the house was painted and rehabilitated, plumbing
was installed and Mr. and Mrs. Pell moved in.</p>
<p>While Mr. Pell made a complete study of fortifications
before one stone was touched at the Fort, Mrs. Pell worked
incessantly on plans for the &ldquo;Pavilion&rdquo; and the Jardin du
Roi. From various members of the Pell family she painstakingly
gathered together pieces of furniture originally
from the &ldquo;Pavilion,&rdquo; and added to it her collection of furniture
<span class="pb" id="Page_100">100</span>
from her family, Gibbs and Thompson. She purchased
only the most minor items, old hooked rugs, curtains and
draperies. She was always tremendously interested in the
Fort and contributed generously not only valuable additions
to its Museum collection, but a vast knowledge of the
authenticity of relics and was a true partner in the restoration
of Fort Ticonderoga.</p>

</div>
<p>Alfred C. Bossom of New York was selected to be the
architect of the restoration of the Fort. The Tercentenary
Celebration on Lake Champlain provided an occasion for
getting the work under way.</p>
<p>At that time President Taft visited the Fort together
with the Ambassadors of France and England, the Governor
of the States of New York and Vermont and a most
distinguished company. The preparations for this were
started in 1908, and with such good results that by the time
of the celebration the west barracks were ready for a preliminary
inspection.</p>
<p>The natives in the surrounding country had to a very
large extent appropriated for use in their own houses the
stone walls that had fallen down but by careful excavation
the precise plan of the original Fort has been entirely laid
bare. To aid this, and to verify many points that were more
or less uncertain, exceeding courtesy was extended by the
British Museum. Photographs and reproductions of all the
drawings there existing were forwarded and permission was
given to search the records in both the English and French
<span class="pb" id="Page_101">101</span>
War Departments. At Ottawa the archivist of the Canadian
Government also provided all the information available and
photographs of the drawings on file. Of course in America
all of the various authorities have cooperated to the utmost
of their ability, and with this it has been possible to carry
on the work of restoration without any uncertainty.</p>

<p>One of the best maps of the Military Reservation was
made by a man named Jeffreys, who was sent out to make
surveys of the forts in this country by the Prince of Wales,
who afterward became George III. His work was conducted
under considerable handicap and was not as accurate as it
might have been, but this map contains a lot of very useful
information that is not given on any other.</p>
<p>The engineer who laid out the Fort, de Lotbiniere,
followed the plans and specifications of the great French
engineer, Vauban. When the work of restoration was started
Mr. Pell obtained from France the original manuscript of
<span class="pb" id="Page_102">102</span>
Vauban&rsquo;s &ldquo;Traite des Fortifications.&rdquo; The book is a fascinating
leather bound folio containing many illuminated
illustrations of bastions, demilunes, moats, and all paraphernalia
of eighteenth century fortifications. This book is one
of the most priceless possessions of the Fort library today.</p>
<p>The Fort itself is about 530 feet in diameter from point
to point as seen on the various plans. The wall on the north
is comparatively low, the fort on this side being approached
by a glacis, but on the west could be approached from the
level along a grassy slope which ran to the top of a wall
at the Fort about 4 feet and 6 inches high, which formed a
counterscarp. To the south, a wall guarded the entrance to
Lake George and was of a very considerable height, and
below this existed the French Village. The French Village
of traders and settlers had been behind a stockaded wall,
protected by the guns of the Fort. The houses were built
on either side of a center walk, and consisted of small stone
dwellings, sutler&rsquo;s stores, warehouses and a blacksmith shop.
On the east side a wall approached very close to the bastions
and it was from about this point a wide covered way (which
was never completed) extended through the rock to the
Grenadiers&rsquo; Battery, an outlying fort located at the extreme
end of the promontory.</p>
<p>The Place d&rsquo;Armes in the center of the fort was surrounded
on three sides by barracks and on the fourth or
north side by a bomb-proof. The bomb proof was of arched
masonry construction where the garrison kept stores that
would be damaged by weather.</p>
<p>Of the barracks, the most important was that located
towards the west, and it was here that Ethan Allen found
Captain Delaplace at the time of the capture. The ground
floor of this building was divided up into a mess room with
a kitchen at one end and a scullery at the other. The oven
in the scullery when excavated was found to be in perfect
condition, the iron doors and dampers still being in their
original position.</p>

<p class="pcap"><span class="sc">Entrance To Place D&rsquo;Armes</span></p>
</div>
<p>In the second story a number of rooms existed which
could be approached by the exterior wooden staircase, and
these are now used as a library and office. The outer sides of
the various barracks were protected by the curtain walls and
the walk behind these was generally at a level of about 8
feet above the Place d&rsquo;Armes.</p>
<p>The drinking water for the barracks could be obtained
in the usual way from a military well located about one
hundred yards to the north of the fort, but under the northwest
bastion and under the south barracks are two large
stone cisterns about 18 feet deep to which all the rain that
fell upon the roofs of the buildings was directed by means
of underground drains. The one under the bastion was
found to be in perfect condition with its pump and plunger
as good as when last used.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_104">104</div>
<p>The accumulation of a century had to be excavated
from between the walls of the various buildings. The courtyard
of the fort was between six and seven feet below and
in the west barracks, particularly under the bastions, the
excavation necessary was over 16 feet to get down to the
original surface. Everything that was found during the
restoration period was kept for the museum, and the workmen
in handling this showed particular interest, and all of
the time this work of excavating continued most interesting
finds were made, such as pottery, firearms, pieces of hardware
and buttons. So many of the numbered buttons have
been found that it is possible to trace by them the name
of each of the regiments that was stationed at the Fort.</p>
<p>Some of these buttons belong to regiments of which no
other account has been found of their residence here, such
as the Twenty-first, and in this case it is inferred that they
belonged to British prisoners of war who were brought down
from St. Johns. One of the most interesting relics was a
piece of a punch bowl of white china decorated in blue,
and across the bottom of which is inscribed, &ldquo;Success to
General Amherst.&rdquo; This in all probability must have been a
presentation piece made either before the General left
England or at some point on his way to take up his command
at the Fort, and left behind when he departed. This has
come down to us in as good condition as it was in the day
it was made.</p>
<p>The roof of tile had fallen in, but sufficient remained
so that more could be produced to fill out the deficiencies,
though some hundreds of different specimens of clay had to
be baked before one was found that was exactly the same
form and color of those originally used.</p>
<p>The flooring of the first floor was also of very heavy,
thick tile and the same condition was experienced with
these. Enough bricks have been found to make it unnecessary
to get any new ones, for apparently these were of so little
<span class="pb" id="Page_105">105</span>
value to the natives that they were not purloined. In the
rebuilding of the walls the stones were replaced in their
identical positions, similar mortar was used, and heads and
jambs of all openings had remained in approximately the
positions from which they fell, so much so that with care
these today occupy the same position that they had before
the walls were torn down.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig51">
<img src="images/p48.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="615" />
<p class="pcap"><span class="sc">The Place D&rsquo;Armes</span></p>
</div>
<p>The mode of procedure followed in making the excavations
was to cut the trench on either side of any walls uncovered
and by this means specimens of all the hardware,
such as door handles, latches, window catches, bolts and
bars were recovered. In many cases the hinges had portions
of the old timber still attached and from this it was possible
to determine the wood used and its thickness. In some cases
the larger bar hinges had the wood so well preserved that
<span class="pb" id="Page_106">106</span>
the different pieces that were joined together to form the
doors were very readily discernible. The timber used was
largely local chestnut and oak, which have since almost disappeared
from the locality, but enough trees have been
found to enable the restored work in all cases to be of the
same material as that originally employed. The ceiling of
the first floor was composed of rough hewn logs with a
heavy double floor on top. The walls throughout the first
and second stories were of rough plaster and in many cases
the stones projected right through and showed on the face.</p>
<p>The fireplaces resembled the construction on the outside
being of rough stones with cut stone jambs and heads.</p>
<p>The four bastions at the corners of the fort were used
respectively for powder magazine, bakery and two for stores,
and under these were unearthed a very considerable quantity
of cannon balls, picks, shovels, china and glass, cutlery, bar
shot and complete material such as a fortress of this kind
would require. Upon excavating these the form of construction
originally employed was quite apparent. The floor
was built up from rock with a complete system of drains
beneath to carry off any surface water, and the roof was
carried upon heavy wooden beams and posts, crowned by
flagstones forming the deck of the bastion itself. The drains
beneath the floor had outlets leading to the moat or ditch,
which in the usual way was dry, but when an attacking
force was anticipated it was possible to dam the outlet from
this and the moat could be flooded by the melting of the
winter snows, as several months&rsquo; advance information in
those days could readily be obtained before an attack was
likely to take place.</p>

<p>The job of repairing and restoring Fort Ticonderoga
has consisted mostly of putting stones back in place. At
least ninety per cent of the walls are built from the original
stone, which had fallen or slipped into the moat. (The
floor tiles were originally made on the place from a blue
clay from the lake shores by French potters. The same
clay was used in the restoration, and the same methods,
and it is impossible to tell today which are the originals
and which the copies.) Every bit of iron work used in the
restoration was copied from an example found in the ruins.
The great oak beams came from a half dozen jobs in the
Adirondacks and were rough-hewn as were the originals.
The carriages upon which the guns are mounted, if not
original, are exact copies and the cannon themselves are all
French, British and American of the period, presented by
the American, British, Dutch, Haiten, San Dominican and
Nicaraguan Governments, or presented by individuals
(notably DeLancey Kountze) or purchased whenever they
were found on the market. An immense amount of material
has been found on the place itself&mdash;a cannon, thousands of
<span class="pb" id="Page_108">108</span>
cannon balls, hand grenades, swivel balls and grape shot,
barrels of bullets and barrels of flints, tomahawks, hatchets,
axes, hoes, gun barrels, gun locks, bayonets, sword blades,
keys, hinges, door locks and every kind of tool&mdash;everything
that an army could use&mdash;dug up wherever a spade is put
in the ground and only a couple of years ago one of the
rarest finds we have ever made&mdash;the breast plate of a suit
of half-armor, French, early 18th century.</p>
<p>First restorations actually were carried out a wall a
season. The first wing completed (the officers&rsquo; mess and
quarters) was filled with relics which Mr. Pell and other
members of his family had been accumulating through the
years. This was accomplished just in time to lock it for
protection of its contents when he went off to World War I.</p>
<p>Before Mr. Pell had gone to France he had no idea
of charging admission to see the ruins and relics. But during
his absence so many visitors came asking for admittance that
Mrs. Pell, who spent her summers there superintending the
work while her husband was overseas, was forced to hire a
full-time guide and charge sight-seers a small sum to pay
his salary. The first balance left after his salary was paid
was used for the purchase of some cannon of the Revolutionary
period which Mr. Pell had located in the West Indies
years before.</p>
<p>When restoration got under way after the war, Mr.
Pell&rsquo;s infectious enthusiasm for Fort Ticonderoga and his
host of friends all over the world, brought forth assistance
from many unexpected sources. Only a few of the cannon
actually used at Ticonderoga could be located, since George
Washington himself had ordered those there during the
early days of the Revolution sent over the snow to the siege
of Boston. But Mr. Pell wanted the demilunes rearmed
with authentic guns of the period. Lord Charles Beresford
and Lord Haldane, hearing of the effort to restore the fort
where some of their ancestors had fought, became interested
and persuaded the British government to send fourteen large
<span class="pb" id="Page_109">109</span>
24-pounders, actually cast in England for use in America
during the Revolution but never shipped because the war
ended too soon. After that, as Mr. Pell expressed it, he was
literally bombarded with cannon, from unexpected sources.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig53">
<img src="images/p50.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="573" />
<p class="pcap"><span class="sc">The Ethan Allen Door</span> (Upper Left)</p>
</div>
<p>Colonel Robert Means Thompson, father of Mrs. Pell,
found and purchased twelve French bronze guns and mortars
of the type used by the fort&rsquo;s first builders. Yale University
deposited cannon donated by an old graduate, DeLancey
Kountze, but never displayed for lack of space. H. Jermain
Slocum, retired Charleston, South Carolina, financier and
nephew of the late Russell Sage, at his own expense went
cannon hunting through the West Indies and South America,
buying and donating many, and persuading Haiti, the
Dominican Republic, Panama and Nicaragua to send others
to the fort. The Netherlands, as well as the United States
Army, also helped him arm the ramparts until they took on
their original warlike aspect.</p>
<p>Archer M. Huntington became interested, and through
the years was a large contributor to Ticonderoga&rsquo;s restoration
fund.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_110">110</div>
<p>Scions of Philip Schuyler, Alexander Hamilton, Israel
Putnam, Anthony Wayne and many other men in some
way connected with Ticonderoga have deposited possessions
of their ancestors within the fort. Collectors of Revolutionary
rifles, swords, powder horns and snuff boxes have willed
their entire collections, the result of many years&rsquo; searches,
to be kept intact here. Even casual visitors have been so
impressed that they have gone home and shipped family
relics that the museum could never have acquired by purchase.
Others have appointed themselves Ticonderoga scouts
who voluntarily tipped Mr. Pell off when they located desirable
objects.</p>
<p>One of the museum&rsquo;s proud possessions is a blunderbuss
used by Ethan Allen in taking the fort from the British, then
given by him to Benedict Arnold, who in turn gave it to
John Trumbull, the Revolutionary artist. It was purchased
by the grandfather of Maj. Philip Rhinelander at a sale of
Trumbull&rsquo;s effects, and the Rhinelander family in turn presented
it to the museum. Mr. Pell&rsquo;s pet treasure was a
hollow silver bullet taken from one of Sir Henry Clinton&rsquo;s
messengers to Burgoyne just before the latter surrendered at
Saratoga. On capture, so papers accompanying the bullet
show, the courier swallowed this container of secret dispatches
and refused to take a &ldquo;physick&rdquo; until tough colonials
threatened to &ldquo;rip his bellie&rdquo; open. The silver bullet was
presented to the fort by Henry O. Tallmadge, a descendant
of a Colonel Tallmadge, who was present when it was
captured. Other bullets show marks of teeth made while
being held in soldiers&rsquo; mouths during floggings or amputations.</p>
<p>At the present time the Fort is visited by some 200,000
people every summer. Schools in Vermont and parts of
New York State send their children in busloads every year
to see it. Many people come back regularly every season to
revisit the Fort and re-enjoy the surrounding scenery. The
beauty of the point on which the Fort stands overlooking
Lake Champlain and of the surrounding meadows and woods
is appreciated, consciously and unconsciously, by all of the
<span class="pb" id="Page_111">111</span>
many visitors. It is a commonplace thing for people who
have entered the Fort to return to pick up cameras in their
parked autos in order to be able to take photographs in the
beautiful surroundings.</p>
<p>Fort Ticonderoga is a living page of American history&mdash;the
most faithfully restored Fort in America and houses
the greatest collection of Revolutionary and Colonial objects.</p>
<p>Although the history of the Fort extends back over 200
years, its present condition, and the incomparable museum
which it contains have resulted from the vision and work of
one man, Stephen Pell. It is fortunate indeed that as a boy
he found a beautiful little bronze flint box containing a flint.
And it is fortunate that he grew to be the kind of man who
was capable of turning a dream into a living fact.</p>
<p>Mrs. Stephen Pell, through her great vision and understanding
encouraged Mr. Pell in his life work, and in
addition gave generously in time and money for the
restoration.</p>
<p>In 1931, Mr. and Mrs. Stephen Pell established the
Fort Ticonderoga Association, a non-profit membership
corporation organized under the educational laws of the
State of New York. The objectives of the Association are
to preserve, maintain and develop the Fort and Museum
and the surrounding grounds for the benefit of the public.
Mr. Stephen Pell remained President of the Fort Ticonderoga
Association until his death in 1950, and his son,
John H. G. Pell, has carried forward this great work as
President since that time.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including

to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means

Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
